### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Anita ! I'm curious about entering the world of data science. I have masters in Statistics so I thought Data Science would be a great opportunity to explore & apply my Statistical knowledge. While attending Lambda school, I honed my new skill in Data analysis, Machine learning and Computer science with my dedication, commitment & hard work. I hope to continue to dig deeper in these areas and explore more.
